HScheme is a simplified Scheme. There are some differences between them.

===========================

### HScheme has

* Primitive type: Int, Double, Bool

* BuiltIn Operators (they are not functions, so can't be passed and returned):
    * arith: +, -, *, /, %,
    * compare: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=
    * logic: ||, &&, !


* If Expression and Cond Expression

* Lambda Expression

* Closure

* First-Class Function

* Everything is immutable
